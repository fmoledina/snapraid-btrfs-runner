# Snapraid-BTRFS Runner Script

This script is based on the [Chronial/snapraid-runner](https://github.com/Chronial/snapraid-runner)
project and runs [snapraid-btrfs](https://github.com/automorphism88/snapraid-btrfs), sending
its output to the console, a log file and via email. All this is configurable.

It can be run manually, but its main purpose is to be run via cronjob or systemd unit.

Given the use of the BTRFS filesystem, this script is only supported on Linux. It requires at least python3.7.

## How to use

* If you donâ€™t already have it, download and install
  [the latest python version](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Clone this repository via git.
* Copy/rename the `snapraid-btrfs-runner.conf.example` to `snapraid-btrfs-runner.conf` and
  edit its contents. You need to at least configure the following configuration items:
  * `snapraid-btrfs.executable`
  * `snapper.executable`
  * `snapraid.executable`
  * `snapraid.config`
* Run the script via `python3 snapraid-btrfs-runner.py`.

See the init dir for a sample systemd timer for automatic scheduled runs.

## Features

Includes all the snapraid-runner features:

* Runs `diff` before `sync` to see how many files were deleted and aborts if
  that number exceeds a set threshold.
* Can create a size-limited rotated logfile.
* Can send notification emails after each run or only for failures.
* Can run `scrub` after `sync`
* Support for healthchecks.io status checks (see `snapraid-btrfs-runner.conf.example`)

Includes basic snapraid-btrfs features of taking BTRFS snapshots in conjunction with snapraid operations (i.e.
`diff`, `sync`, `cleanup`, and `scrub`). This script omits access to many underlying snapraid-btrfs options, given its intended
use as an unattended automatic snapraid tool. Features include:

* Uses `snapraid-btrfs` for `diff`, `sync`, and `scrub` operations
* Can run `pool` and/or `cleanup` between `sync` and `scrub`

## TODO

* Nothing for now
